For 1p1c, semaphore S is not necessary since mutex is not mandatory here, after producer writes the file, the consumer is then waken up to read the file.

For 1pmc, mutex is added to consumer.c in order to make sure only one consumer can access the critical section at the same time.

For mp1c, mutex is added to producer.c in order to make sure only one producer can access the critical section at the same time.

For mcmc, mutex is needed for both producer and consumer.
